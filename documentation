first we created index.js file
in console of vscode we did npm init
after giving basic details package.json file is created
then we created multiple files- config controllers models routes views 
 npm intall express - it downloads the latest version of the express in the folder  
 //in index.js file we import express and we'll make app to listen to the server port 8000 in this case
 //we'll do - git init
 //git commit -m "First commit: create the directory structure and setup express server"
 //cd .. then git log
 //we'll create index.js in routes and import expess and call  the router
 home_controller in controllers file
 index.js to routes/index.js
 if required index.js users.js
 from above scripts we can move to controllers/home_controllers or users_controllers

 now we are creating layouts 
 npm install express-ejs-layouts

 how layouts work
 we have create a file named layouts.ejs in views
 it automatically goes to layouts.ejs first
 it acts as a main page with variables 
 when ever we type ./home or /profile the variable data is filled and rendered to the html page
 
 next is setting up mongoDb that is database

 we creted assets folder and 3 folders in it
