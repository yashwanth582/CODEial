first we created index.js file
in console of vscode we did npm init
after giving basic details package.json file is created
then we created multiple files- config controllers models routes views 
 npm intall express - it downloads the latest version of the express in the folder  
 //in index.js file we import express and we'll make app to listen to the server port 8000 in this case
 //we'll do - git init
 //git commit -m "First commit: create the directory structure and setup express server"
 //cd .. then git log
 //we'll create index.js in routes and import expess and call  the router
 home_controller in controllers file
 index.js to routes/index.js
 if required index.js users.js
 from above scripts we can move to controllers/home_controllers or users_controllers

 now we are creating layouts 
 npm install express-ejs-layouts

 how layouts work
 we have create a file named layouts.ejs in views
 it automatically goes to layouts.ejs first
 it acts as a main page with variables 
 when ever we type ./home or /profile the variable data is filled and rendered to the html page
 
 next is setting up mongoDb that is database

 we creted assets folder and 3 folders in it
 
 mongoDb setup - create a file monogoose.js in config
 npm intall mongoose
  after exporting the mongoose file import in main index.js file

we created two files in views user_sign_in page and user_sign_up page
In users controller export two properties signUp and signIn 
And in routes --> router.get('/sign-up', usersController.signUp);
added two features in users_controller create and create session
We created two forms in user_sign_in and up pages
Now we have to add cookie parses to the main index file
npm install cookie-parser in index file
import cookie-parser in index.js file that is using require
we imported user from models in users_controller.js  
We created a post in users.js when ever create function is called the following data is posted. that is present in the users_controller where we fill the create function completely
We commited till signup page
(git checkout -b manual-local-auth) we have changed the branch.we'll return to the sign up after completing the manual-local-auth

we have changed the content in the user_controller profile content
 before when ever user logs in into account and profile page is opened, it was possible that user can go back to sign in page again. which should'nt be happened. so check in the cookies that if user is presernt in it we let the account to access the profile
